# Stable Diffusion XL Base 1.0 - Basic Usage Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the basic usage of the `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` model for image generation using Stable Diffusion techniques. It is designed to provide a straightforward example of generating images from text prompts.

## Overview

- The notebook guides through the process of loading and utilizing the Stable Diffusion XL Base 1.0 model.
- It includes steps for setting up the model, defining parameters for the image generation process, and generating images from text prompts.
- The notebook is intended for those who are beginning to explore the capabilities of text-to-image generation models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a compatible Python environment with necessary libraries like `torch` and `transformers` installed.
- A CUDA-enabled GPU is recommended for efficient model operations.

### Usage

1. **Model Setup**: The notebook includes code to download and load the Stable Diffusion model from the Hugging Face model hub.

2. **Image Generation**: You can input your own text prompts to generate images. The notebook provides an example of how to define parameters like `n_steps` and `high_noise_frac` for controlling the image generation process.

3. **Result Visualization**: The generated images are displayed directly in the notebook for immediate viewing.

## Note

- This notebook serves as an introductory guide to using the Stable Diffusion model and is not intended for advanced modifications or specific use-cases.
- The quality of generated images depends on several factors, including the nature of the text prompts and model parameters.
